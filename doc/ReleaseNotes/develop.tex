	\underline{NEW FUNCTIONALITY}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A new Groundwater Energy (GWE) transport model is introduced to the code base for simulating heat transport in the subsurface.  Additional information for activating the GWE model type within a MODFLOW 6 simulation is available within the mf6io.pdf document.  New example problems have been developed for testing and demonstrating GWE capabilities (in addition to other internal tests that help verify the accuracy of GWE); however, additional changes to the code and input may be necessary in response to user needs and further testing.

	\underline{ADVANCED STRESS PACKAGES}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Refactoring of the Water Mover package in version 6.4.3 introduced a reduction in performance for GWF models with a large number of movers.  The program was corrected so that performance is similar to previous versions.

	\underline{EXCHANGES}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A model budget error would occur when a constant-head cell in one model had a direct connection to an active cell in another model.  For the model budget to be calculated correctly a new term called ``FLOW-JA-FACE-CHD'' was added to the GWF model budget.  This term is only included in the table when the GWF Model is connected to another GWF Model using a GWF-GWF Exchange.
