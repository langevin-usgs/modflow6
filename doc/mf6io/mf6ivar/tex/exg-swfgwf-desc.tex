\begin{description}
\item \texttt{PRINT\_INPUT}---keyword to indicate that the list of exchange entries will be echoed to the listing file immediately after it is read.

\item \texttt{PRINT\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that the list of exchange flow rates will be printed to the listing file for every stress period in which ``SAVE BUDGET'' is specified in Output Control.

\item \texttt{OBS6}---keyword to specify that record corresponds to an observations file.

\item \texttt{FILEIN}---keyword to specify that an input filename is expected next.

\item \texttt{obs6\_filename}---is the file name of the observations input file for this exchange. See the ``Observation utility'' section for instructions for preparing observation input files. Table \ref{table:gwf-obstypetable} lists observation type(s) supported by the SWF-GWF package.

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{nexg}---keyword and integer value specifying the number of SWF-GWF exchanges.

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{cellidm1}---is the cellid of the cell in model 1 as specified in the simulation name file. For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, CELLIDM1 is the layer, row, and column numbers of the cell.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, CELLIDM1 is the layer number and CELL2D number for the two cells.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, then CELLIDM1 is the node number for the cell.

\item \texttt{cellidm2}---is the cellid of the cell in model 2 as specified in the simulation name file. For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, CELLIDM2 is the layer, row, and column numbers of the cell.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, CELLIDM2 is the layer number and CELL2D number for the two cells.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, then CELLIDM2 is the node number for the cell.

\item \texttt{cond}---is the conductance between the surface water cell and the groundwater cell.
